# Readme Generator
### A simple time-saving script

This repository is for a readme generation project made for my UC Berkeley coding bootcamp. It ouputs a pre-formatted readme.md file based on user input, making it quicker and easier to create readmes without unnecessary boilerplate.

There is no license for this project and it is intended for educational purposes only.
